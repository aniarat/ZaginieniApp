# ZaginieniApp

A progressive web application to support the searching of missing persons.

## INTRODUCTION

This project was created as part of an engineering thesis. Its goal is to significantly reduce the response time of the services to a reported missing person. Since the outcome of the search largely depends on the involvement of people, especially in the first hours after the disappearance, it is important to quickly inform as many people as possible about such an event. The availability of a tool in the form of a mobile application in the age of the Internet community can contribute to the immediate spread of information about the missing person.
